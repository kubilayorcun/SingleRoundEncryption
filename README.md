# SingleRoundEncryption
Implementation of a single round encryption algorithm with java for a school project assignment.


### Executing

To execute the code after you clone or download it;

```
cd /SingleRoundEncryption
javac Test.java
java Test
```

There will be newly created files beside compiled .class files;

- CipherTextFile
- DecipheredTextFile

:exclamation: PlainTextFile should only include encoded characters within the java files. Otherwise encryption will not be done correctly.

:star: I will be back to add input validation and correction features ASAP.
